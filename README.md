# 32-bit Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor

This project implements a **single-cycle 32-bit RISC-V processor** using **Verilog HDL**.  
It covers the design, simulation, and verification of basic RISC-V modules, and their integration into a complete working processor.  

### Features
- Core modules: Multiplexer, ALU, Immediate Generator, Register File (32-bit)
- Instruction Memory & Data Memory modules
- Instruction Fetch Datapath and Control Unit
- Integrated into a fully functional single-cycle processor
- Simulated using **ModelSim** and synthesizable for FPGA targets (**Intel Quartus Prime / Xilinx Vivado**)

### Applications
- Learning resource for digital design & computer architecture
- Demonstrates Verilog-based hardware design flow
- Basis for extending to pipelined or advanced RISC-V designs
